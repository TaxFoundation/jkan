title: State & Local Tax Burden per Capita & as a Percentage of Income
organization: Tax Foundation
notes: |
  Data from years 1977 to present are available at State-Local Tax Burden Rankings. Payments made to out-of-state governments are tallied in the taxpayer's state of residence where possible. D.C.'s rank does not affect states' ranks, but the figure in parentheses indicates where it would rank if included. See Table 39 for average people per household by state.
