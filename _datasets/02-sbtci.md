title: State Business Tax Climate Index
organization: Tax Foundation
notes: |
  The State Business Tax Climate Index measures how each state's tax laws affect economic performance. A rank of 1 means the state's tax system is more favorable for business; a rank of 50 means the state's tax system is less favorable for business. Component rankings do not average to the total. States without a given tax are ranked equally as number 1. D.C.'s ranks do not affect states' ranks, but the figures in parentheses indicate where it would rank if included.
